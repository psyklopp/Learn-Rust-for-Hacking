# Learn-Rust-for-Hacking
Having studied computer science, I think this is time to learn one language for good. Although I have a lot of experience using Java, I want to pivot to the security side and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) seems to be the perfect choice (for me). There are a lot of languages but since I want to start from the very beginning, why not choose a language which is fast, efficient and memory-safe.

I have no idea what to expect from Rust but will document the journey.

My main sources for help, reference and documentation will be [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) and [Black Hat Rust](https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust).
